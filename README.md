## The challenge

### Expected behaviour

- First-level comments should be ordered by their score, whereas nested replies are ordered by time added.
- Replying to a comment adds the new reply to the bottom of the nested replies within that comment.
- A confirmation modal should pop up before a comment or reply is deleted.

- You can only edit or delete your own comments and replies.

HOW I LEFT OFF
 I TRIED TO PUSH EVERY REPLY TO ITS RESPECTIVE COMMENT ARRAY I.E
 replied:[]
 but how to go around that is now a problem since you can't modify a state outside of its reducer
